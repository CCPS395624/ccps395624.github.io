<h1>About Me</h1>
              <p>Within my personal life I am working towards a higher education, a high paying job, and more. Throughout my life there have been many obstacles thrown at me, but the only people helping me are my family and friends. The person who influenced me the most to work hard and never give up is my father, when I mature, I want to be as hard working, and more successful than him.

 

I am working towards these goals by working hard in school, and training my brain outside of school, a big part of why I have a hard working mindset is my soccer career, I play full time soccer at Naples High School, and part time soccer at Azzurri, and although many people don't take athletics serious, I take my athletics as a life line.

 

  The values that I consider most important for success are trust, determination, and respect, these 3 components in my opinion are necessary for success, because without trust, nobody will believe you, and trust plays a big role within a business, Next we have determination, this also plays a massive role within a business, because without hard work nothing will be accomplished, and to end it off, respect, this is by far the most important component of the 3, because respect is a massive part of how people judge others, so regarding this reason I believe that respect is another massive part of the 3 components.

 

My short time goals consist of 5 things, the first one being to win the state cup within my soccer team, number 2 being to graduate high school, number 3 is to become fluent in Spanish, number 4 is to start my own business, and the last one is to make as many friends as possible within my high school years.

 

Within my life I want to be known for my respect, generosity, and hardworking, and I most want to be known for as being the best soccer player that has ever lived.</p>
